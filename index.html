    <h1>Motorcycles vs Cars</h1>

    <hr />

    <p>The world has long debated the use of 4 wheels vs 2.  Which is better?  Can we definitively say that God intended us to travel by car or motorcycle?
    Until now, we simply have not had the technology.  But thanks to advances in molecular research, we may now have an answer. </p>
    
    <h3>Motorcycles are far superior to cars, and here is why.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Motorcyles are much more stable in the rain (this is a fact).</li>
        <li>Unlike cars, motorcycles never tip over.</li>
        <li>The likeliness of hitting your head on a winshield is almost zero on a motorcycle (unless it is the car that hit you). </li>
        <li>Many more accidents occur involving cars than motorcycles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The proof is in the research!</h3>
